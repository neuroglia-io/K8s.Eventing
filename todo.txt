SUBSCRIPTION:
-------------

- Should dispatch only to its subscribers. (Bypass mediator and implement in the subscription class???)
- Should reconsider the topic name for cloud events. Maybe one generic 'cloud-event' topic could be used instead (inability to use streaming when using a 'type' regex (assign vs subscribe) => NOK)

DISPATCHING:
------------

- Implement quality of service
- Implement retry policies to handle 503
